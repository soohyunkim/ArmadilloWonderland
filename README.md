# ArmadilloWonderland
My creative outlet using THREE.js, webgl, and an armadillo object. 

1. To run each project, navigate to the folder and start a server. 
    Eg. `http-server . -p 8000`
2. Then in your folder, navigate to port 8000 (in this case) in your browser
3. Go to localhost:8000/`FolderName`.html
